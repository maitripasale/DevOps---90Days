# What is DevOps?

- DevOps is a culture that requires a mindset change on how we develop & deploy application, meaning it's a set of practices that help to reach the goal of this movement: reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever it could be an internal team or customer.

- From a DevOps perspective, Development, Testing and Deployment all land with the DevOps team.

- **Automation** plays a major role in DevOps

- The DevOps Cycle consist of two fields:
  - **Software Development**
    - Plan → planning and gathering requirements of your software
    - Code → writing the code + testing
    - Build → compiling the code as to build the application
  - **Operations**
    - Release → deployed on the server
    - Operate → actual running of your application
    - Monitoring → observing & tracking the performance

- All these phases are in continuous form i.e after last phase it starts all over again when we want to develop or add new features on top of the application
- Thus it results in fast development & releasing results speedly to the end users.

- `Security` is a part of every stage in the DevOps cycle

## Roadmap

I found this [DevOps Roadmap](https://github.com/maitripasale/DevOps-90Days/files/8632104/DevOps.roadmap.2022.pdf) as a great resource and I will be documenting all the resources and learnings from this roadmap.
